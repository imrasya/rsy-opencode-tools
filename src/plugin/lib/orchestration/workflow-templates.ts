/**
 * Workflow Templates — pre-built multi-phase node configurations
 *
 * Instead of planning every complex task from scratch, the planner can
 * instantiate a known-good template for common patterns (release, migration,
 * security audit, large refactor). Each template produces a set of
 * CreateNodeInput plus dependency edges, ready to add to a TaskGraph.
 *
 * Templates are intentionally conservative: they encode phase structure and
 * verification gates, not project-specific commands. The AI fills in concrete
 * details per node at execution time.
